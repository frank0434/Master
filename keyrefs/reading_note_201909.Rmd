_Note_

1. temp was not the only factro affecting DM production rate. section 4.3.2.5

2. Seedling lucerne did not display constant DM partitioning below ground which suggests
a single Proot value was inappropriate for seedling growth

3. a desired root biomass is 4 to 5 t DM/ha

_Questions_

1. what are the rules to decide the regrowth cycle?

2. section 4.3.2.5. growth rate differed at the same mean air temperature dependingon the direction of temperature change? -- is it ture temperature effect of photoperiod? 


3. Pp effect on DM partitioning to the root were not consistent in two sites?  -
**Seedling lucerne grown at Ashley Dene did not show the same seasonal variation, which suggests crop ontogeny when under water stress overrides the environmental signals which regulate partitioning. The Proot of seedling crops was maintained at 0.53 for all sowing dates (Figure 4.10).** -- is this ture?

4. self-thinning - what is the driver? resources?

short and long regrowth durations. what were the exact days??

Variation in water extraction with maize plant density and its impact on model
application

Incorrect parameterisation using constant kl values across plant populations could therefore cause erroneous  recommendations to be made, and these results have implications for any previously conducted crop simulations that use similar methods to model soil water extraction
when investigating a range of plant populations

Richard PHD thesis

Water use (WU) is often calculated as the minimum of the actual crop transpiration (ET)
and the potential transpiration which represents the demand for water from the canopy
(EPT) (Ritchie, 1972; Monteith, 1986) (Equation 6.1);
Equation 6.1 $WU = min(ET, EPT )$
The amount of water in the soil, soil water content (SWC) was calculated to a depth of
2.3 m using Equation 6.2 Equation 6.2 $SWC = \sum_{bot}^{top} \theta*d$

Where θ is the volumetric water content (VWC) of individual layers as measured in
Section 6.2.1.2, d is the depth of the layer, top is the 0 to 0.2 m layer and bot is the 2.2
to 2.3 m layer.



The water use (WU, mm per period) was calculated for each measurement period using
Equation 6.3;
Equation 6.3 $WU = PR – (SWC_E – SWC_S)$
Where PR is the sum of rainfall for the same period, SWCS and SWCE represent the
actual soil water content of the profile as measured (Section 6.2.1.2) for the start and
end of the period, respectively. This equation assumes no rainfall is lost as drainage or
runoff.

Future research should use the supply and demand method rather than the site and crop
specific critical limiting deficit framework to quantify water stress. Water stress can be
quantified as transpiration (ET) in relation to demand (EPT) and related to yield forming
components to allow comparisons between crops and sites. This is important because
the critical limiting deficit method is site and species specific. This method uses SWD
as a measure of water stress and relates it to yield to define a critical level where yield is
decreased (Penman, 1971). Furthermore, it offers no explanation of the mechanisms
responsible for the yield decrease
