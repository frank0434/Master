_Note_

1. temp was not the only factro affecting DM production rate. section 4.3.2.5

2. Seedling lucerne did not display constant DM partitioning below ground which suggests
a single Proot value was inappropriate for seedling growth

3. a desired root biomass is 4 to 5 t DM/ha

_Questions_

1. what are the rules to decide the regrowth cycle?

2. section 4.3.2.5. growth rate differed at the same mean air temperature dependingon the direction of temperature change? -- is it ture temperature effect of photoperiod? 


3. Pp effect on DM partitioning to the root were not consistent in two sites?  -
**Seedling lucerne grown at Ashley Dene did not show the same seasonal variation, which suggests crop ontogeny when under water stress overrides the environmental signals which regulate partitioning. The Proot of seedling crops was maintained at 0.53 for all sowing dates (Figure 4.10).** -- is this ture?

4. self-thinning - what is the driver? resources?

Variation in water extraction with maize plant density and its impact on model
application

Incorrect parameterisation using constant kl values across plant populations could therefore cause erroneous  recommendations to be made, and these results have implications for any previously conducted crop simulations that use similar methods to model soil water extraction
when investigating a range of plant populations

Richard PHD thesis

Water use (WU) is often calculated as the minimum of the actual crop transpiration (ET)
and the potential transpiration which represents the demand for water from the canopy
(EPT) (Ritchie, 1972; Monteith, 1986) (Equation 6.1);
Equation 6.1 $WU = min(ET, EPT )$
The amount of water in the soil, soil water content (SWC) was calculated to a depth of
2.3 m using Equation 6.2 Equation 6.2 $SWC = \sum_{bot}^{top} \theta*d$

Where θ is the volumetric water content (VWC) of individual layers as measured in
Section 6.2.1.2, d is the depth of the layer, top is the 0 to 0.2 m layer and bot is the 2.2
to 2.3 m layer.



The water use (WU, mm per period) was calculated for each measurement period using
Equation 6.3;
Equation 6.3 $WU = PR – (SWC_E – SWC_S)$
Where PR is the sum of rainfall for the same period, SWCS and SWCE represent the
actual soil water content of the profile as measured (Section 6.2.1.2) for the start and
end of the period, respectively. This equation assumes no rainfall is lost as drainage or
runoff.

Future research should use the supply and demand method rather than the site and crop
specific critical limiting deficit framework to quantify water stress. Water stress can be
quantified as transpiration (ET) in relation to demand (EPT) and related to yield forming
components to allow comparisons between crops and sites. This is important because
the critical limiting deficit method is site and species specific. This method uses SWD
as a measure of water stress and relates it to yield to define a critical level where yield is
decreased (Penman, 1971). Furthermore, it offers no explanation of the mechanisms
responsible for the yield decrease

While the relationship between T
and water stress provides insight into the effects of water stress on
crop water use, it is not necessary to consider in the prediction of
transpiration when transpiration is constrained to the minimum of
supply and demand (Eq. (1)). In contrast, biomass production must
be constrained by water stress. Using the transpiration efficiency
approach, the daily growth increment (G) is first calculated in
the absence of water stress and used to estimate EPD. Then G is
reduced to account for the effects of water stress by multiplying by
a water stress factor, f(W) = EPS/EPD

ideal test data set for apsimx

1. crop phenology development 
2. biomass and nutrient accumulatoin of crop organs
3. measurements of canopy and leaf characteristics
4. soil water and N status across a range fo environments under stressed and unstressed conditions 

water use and stress responses in wheat

1. actual water uptake is the minimum of demand and the water supply that can be extracted by the root system
2. water supply relative to demand S/D
3. stress factor is calculated from S/D that is applied to potential RUE and leaf area expansion each day 
4. water stress effcts on senescence - $TT_{accum}$ 
Efficiency (NSE), Model Error (ME) and Mean Absolute Error
(MAE). When plotting observed vs predicted for all treatment values,
the spread of absolute values is often dominated by environmental
variation from site to site, particularly when the dataset includes experimental
results from a wide range of soil and climate situations. This
tends to obscure how well the model is predicting response to variation
in management (i.e. different experimental treatments) at specific locations
(Mitchell 1997).

**challenges that using large datasets**
1. specific elments lost in the large number of data points.
2. one change can worsen another aspect

a smarter system where developers can fast track the changes effects and the overall model performance.

current lucerne model phenolodogy based on Ed's 2011 paper


Specifically, to
account for sub-optimal growth conditions, lucerne reserve organs
(e.g. crowns and taproots) have to be implemented to store nitrogen,
a root nodule organ is required to fix atmospheric nitrogen and
water stress responses have to be parameterised
