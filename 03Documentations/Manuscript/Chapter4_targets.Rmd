```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```


# Packages

# Setup

First, load `targets` to activate the specialized `knitr` engine for Target Markdown.

```{r}
library(targets)
```

Near the top, you may also wish to remove the `_targets_r` directory previously written by non-interactive runs of the report.

```{r}
tar_unscript()

```

# Globals

We first define some global options/functions common to all targets. The function below plots a histogram of ozone concentrations, and our histogram target will need it.

```{targets exmaple, tar_globals = TRUE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
tar_option_set(packages = c("data.table", "readxl", "magrittr", "DBI", "RSQLite",
                            "ggplot2","openxlsx","cowplot"))
create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = Ozone), bins = 12) +
    theme_gray(24)
}
```

# Targets

Our first target borrows the `airquality` dataset built into base R.

```{targets raw-data}
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
```

Our next targets preprocess the data, make a histogram, and fit a model.

```{targets downstream-targets}
list(
  tar_target(data, raw_data %>% filter(!is.na(Ozone))),
  tar_target(hist, create_plot(data))
)
```

Set the `tar_simple` chunk option to `TRUE` to define a single target with the command in the code chunk. The chunk below only contains `biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)` in the source, but because `tar_simple` is `TRUE`, it is shorthand for `tar_target(name = fit, command = biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data))`. All other arguments to `tar_target()` are set to their default values (configurable with `tar_option_set()`).

```{targets fit, tar_simple = TRUE}
biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)
```

# Pipeline

If you ran all the `{targets}` chunks in non-interactive mode, then your R scripts are set up to run the pipeline.

```{r}
tar_make()
```

# Output

You can retrieve results from the `_targets/` data store using `tar_read()` or `tar_load()`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(biglm)
tar_read(fit)
```

```{r}
tar_read(hist)
```

The `targets` dependency graph helps your readers understand the steps of your pipeline at a high level.

```{r}
tar_visnetwork()
```

At this point, you can go back and run `{targets}` chunks in interactive mode without interfering with the code or data of the non-interactive pipeline.
