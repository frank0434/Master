You have 25 to 30 minutes of talking and then questions – so feel free to e.g. expand all your objectives and show 

e.g. **a soil water profile** from one of the datasets and 
how it was modelled once it has been parametized – 
and actually what is needed to parametize it 
  – i.e. think of this as educating your audience at the same time – many of them actually take soil water measurements – so go from what they measure to how it is represented in the model to then how you want to analyse over several datasets. 
  
  Maybe show a time course of water extraction over a season from a shallow and deep soil –Hamish or Richard dataset -   also go into the fact you have above ground dry matter and are trying to relate the two etc – 
  
  **so – start with what data you have what it means for the model then how you might model it and then how you might use that calibrated model….**

 

Does that make sense?
