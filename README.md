## To clarify

**the development stage of the crop**
trifoliate??
why post-grazing cuts?

1. no relationship between days to 50% seedling emergence or rate of emergence and soil tmep. this indicates that the conditions were not non-limiting. other variables to consider 

## Equations

PSMD = PSMDi-1 + EPi â€“ rainfalli

## Yield difference driver

First attempt to integrate the data sets together from github. 
There are 12 `Excel` files. 
Some of them are duplicated. 
Some of them have insufficient information about the variables and expt locations.
All lack of metadata. 

**To do**

1. Ask if xiumei knows the story behind the data sets.
2. Use only Richard data as a starting point.
