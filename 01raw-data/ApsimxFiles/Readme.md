The note here is aiming to explain the details behind each apsim file.



558K Mar 31 16:56 20191022_LucerneSWCwith_obs.apsimx
	The first apsimx to explore the current lucerne model setup. 
	The results were used in the proposal presentation to demostrate 
	the current model performance under dry land conditions. 

439K Mar 30 12:15 20191211_AshelyDene.apsimx
	This apsimx was the first attempt to mimic what Hamish did for the potato model 
	calibration work. File structure was setup, but hard to do the subsequent analysis in python
	because one didn't quite understand how to calibrate apsim model yet at that time.
	Probably not going to be used now due to its bulk simulation runs, which against the idea of 
	paralle computation. 

433K Mar 30 12:15 20191211_Iversen_8.apsimx
	Similar exploration as for the AshleyDene one. This apsimx file has irrigation and dry land conditions. 

433K Mar 30 12:15 20191211_Iversen_8_root5t.apsimx
	Similar exploration as the one above but change the juvenil stage end at 5t root dry matter.
	No visual difference were found. 

553K May 13 14:51 20200513_LatestCalibration.apsimx
	Guided by Hamish to set up this apsimx for inspecting the water content in different layer. 
	This apsimx file laid out the foundation about how to calibrate a apsimx model visually. 
	
 61K Jun  3 22:44 20200517BaseSlurp.apsimx
	**The main apsimx to work for estimating the kl for different sowing dates.**

428K May 31 17:08 20200520Demo.apsimx
	The demo apsimx for edit feature.
