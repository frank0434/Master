How to calculate initial soil water and parameterise it? 

Should I use one PAWC_profile for all treatment

ask richard how did he calculate the DUL AND LL AND initial soil water? 
ask Hamish/Rog about the parameterisation? 


DUL and LL should be depend on soil 
SWD should be refered to DUL 


2. Initial Soil Water as a Fraction of Available Soil Water distributed evenly down the profile

Initial soil water can be set to a fraction of the maximum available soil water in each layer.
Setting the insoil parameter to a fraction (0 = LL15, 1 = DUL) initialises the soil water parameter (initial sw values are ignored) to this fraction for each layer.

ie. If 0.0 <= Insoil <= 1.0, then
in each layer
Soil water (sw) = LL15 + ((DUL-LL15) x Insoil)
5. Initial Soil Water as a depth of wet soil, filled to field capacity.

Initial soil water can be set to a depth of wet soil.
The profile is filled from the top down until the soil depth is reached.
Setting the wet_soil_depth parameter to a depth of soil filled to field capacity (DUL) initialises the soil water for layers starting at the top of the profile to DUL, until the soil depth is reached.
The remaining layers are set to LL15. This parameter is exclusive of the others.

e.g. Using the soil parameters of the previous example and
wet_soil_depth = 400 mm,
Then
The ESW of each layer is set to 33, 33, 21, 0 mm giving
A total of 87 mm in the profile.
