How to calculate initial soil water and parameterise it? 

Should I use one PAWC_profile for all treatment

ask richard how did he calculate the DUL AND LL AND initial soil water? 
ask Hamish/Rog about the parameterisation? 


DUL and LL should be depend on soil 
SWD should be refered to DUL 


2. Initial Soil Water as a Fraction of Available Soil Water distributed evenly down the profile

Initial soil water can be set to a fraction of the maximum available soil water in each layer.
Setting the insoil parameter to a fraction (0 = LL15, 1 = DUL) initialises the soil water parameter (initial sw values are ignored) to this fraction for each layer.

ie. If 0.0 <= Insoil <= 1.0, then
in each layer
Soil water (sw) = LL15 + ((DUL-LL15) x Insoil)
5. Initial Soil Water as a depth of wet soil, filled to field capacity.

Initial soil water can be set to a depth of wet soil.
The profile is filled from the top down until the soil depth is reached.
Setting the wet_soil_depth parameter to a depth of soil filled to field capacity (DUL) initialises the soil water for layers starting at the top of the profile to DUL, until the soil depth is reached.
The remaining layers are set to LL15. This parameter is exclusive of the others.

e.g. Using the soil parameters of the previous example and
wet_soil_depth = 400 mm,
Then
The ESW of each layer is set to 33, 33, 21, 0 mm giving
A total of 87 mm in the profile.

Hamish
To use the SW for initial soil water, delete the initial soil water node 
DUL and LL can be depend on sowing dates since APSIM is a point based model. 

Hamish 
kl should be link to the root turnover?? 
yes. but it can't be dynamic to reflect the real world stuiation in NZ since the cold temperature could limit the crop water uptake. 
why we can't make the kl calculated on the fly? 
monthly value probably the best you could have but suspect that it still won't reflect the real world senarios. 

Slurp is probably the best way to go so far, since it accounts the incomplete canopy and tempareture. 
curving fitting is not recommended since the assumptions are very easy to be violated in NZ.  


Rog:
elimate the rainfall event for looking the decay of the kls 

swcon is very similar to kls 

filter out the noise to get the 
filter out the period full canopy cover without rainfall 

questions to Richard: 
	1. what happen during the winter - crop is full canopy? 
	2.
